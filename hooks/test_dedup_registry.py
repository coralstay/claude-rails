"""Drift-prevention test for `is_backlog_project()`.

The five hooks below are each fully self-contained (no shared imports, by
design — see require_active_task.py's module docstring), so the
`is_backlog_project()` check is hand-copied into every one of them. That's
exactly how the 2026-09-18 bug happened: the `.git`-existence check landed in
require_active_task.py but never propagated to the other four copies.

This test extracts the `is_backlog_project` function's AST from every hook
module, normalizes away location metadata, and asserts all five are
identical. If someone patches only one copy in the future, this test fails.
